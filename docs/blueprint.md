## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#7395AE) to create a professional, orderly, calm feel, evoking the organization and insights that can come from careful issue tracking. The user request included the recommendation that #2c3e50 and #3498db be primary colors, and the delivered value above is visually consistent.
- Background color: Very light gray (#f0f2f5), close in hue to the primary but highly desaturated to maintain a calm backdrop.
- Accent color: Salmon (#EE7787), analogous to slate blue to add visual interest and call attention to actionable items.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, for a balance of modernity and warmth.
- Font Awesome icons to provide visual cues and enhance usability.
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance the user experience.
